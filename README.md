# Covid_Dashboard
This is a useful site that displays COVID-19 vaccination data in Ireland.
I learned a huge amount working on this website, it's also my first interaction with Javascript. I plan to come back to revise and re-structure the code as I learn more web development best practices.
-vanilla Javascript

The site displays:

- cumulative and weekly vaccination statistics on a per age group basis
- weekly infection rates on a county basis
- implemented using raw html/javascript/css
